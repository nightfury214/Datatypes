# Sets and Set Operations

#### Overview:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### Creating a Set:
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Adding and Removing Elements:
```python
my_set.add(6)  # Adding an element
my_set.remove(3)  # Removing an element
```

#### Set Operations:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

union_set = set1.union(set2)  # Union of sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # Intersection of sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)  # Difference of sets
```

#### Subset and Superset:
```python
is_subset = set1.issubset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a subset of set2
is_superset = set1.issuperset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a superset of set2
```
